## Overview

ResuMatch is a Resume Matching System that aims to match job descriptions with candidates' resumes. It extracts key details from both job descriptions and resumes, processes them, and calculates a similarity score to rank the most suitable candidates for each job. This project was developed as part of [describe the context or purpose of the project].

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `data`: Contains datasets required for the project.
  - `kaggle_resume_dataset`: Contains resume data in CSV format.
  - `hugging_face_job_descriptions`: Contains job descriptions data in CSV format.
- `src`: Contains the project source code.
  - `pdf_extractor.py`: Extracts details from candidate resumes.
  - `text_preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses and tokenizes text data.
  - `similarity_calculator.py`: Calculates similarity scores between job descriptions and candidate resumes.
  - `matching_algorithm.py`: Matches candidates to job descriptions based on similarity scores.
  - `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire process.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python packages for this project.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.6+

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ResuMatch.git
   cd ResuMatch
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it:

  ```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. Install the required packages:
   
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

To run the ResuMatch system, execute the following command:

  ```
  python src/main.py
  ```

This command will start the matching process, and the results will be stored in the appropriate output files.

## Approach

Approach:

In approaching the ResuMatch project, I followed a systematic workflow to achieve the goal of matching job descriptions with candidates' resumes:

### 1. Data Collection:

I collected two primary datasets for this project: the Kaggle Resume Dataset, which contained candidate resumes in PDF format, and the Hugging Face Job Descriptions Dataset, consisting of job descriptions in CSV format.

### 2. Data Extraction and Preprocessing:

To extract valuable information from candidate resumes, I opted to use CSV files. I carefully parsed and validated the content to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
For job descriptions, I processed the CSV file, focusing on data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the text data for further analysis.

### 3. Text Tokenization and Embedding:

To make the textual data machine-readable, I leveraged the pre-trained DistilBERT tokenizer. This step involved breaking down text into smaller units (tokens) while maintaining their semantic meaning.
I used a pre-trained DistilBERT model to convert these tokens into embeddings, which captured the essential information and context of the text.

### 4. Similarity Calculation:

To gauge the similarity between job descriptions and candidate resumes, I computed the cosine similarity score. This metric quantified how closely a candidate's qualifications matched the job requirements, providing a reliable basis for comparison.

### 5. Matching Algorithm:

I devised a custom matching algorithm to rank candidates based on their similarity scores for each job description.
The algorithm effectively selected the top candidates with the highest similarity scores, streamlining the selection process for recruiters.

### 6. Output Generation:

The results of the matching process, including the top candidates for each job description, were meticulously stored in output files. This structured output facilitated further analysis and decision-making.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions:

### 1. Data Extraction and Validation:

Challenge: Parsing and validating content from PDF resumes can be complex.
Solution: I opted to use CSV files to process and validate candidate resume data efficiently. This approach ensured data quality and simplified the data integration process.

### 2. Performance Optimization:

Challenge: Efficiently processing a vast number of candidate resumes and job descriptions required parallel processing.
Solution: I harnessed the power of ThreadPoolExecutor, enabling concurrent processing of resumes and job descriptions. This approach significantly improved performance and reduced processing time.

### 3. Data Integration:

Challenge: Combining data from different sources (CSV job descriptions and parsed PDF resumes) necessitated data cleaning and synchronization.
Solution: Prior to matching, I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the data to harmonize it, ensuring seamless integration.

### 4. Scalability:

Challenge: The system needed to be scalable to handle a substantial volume of candidates and job descriptions.
Solution: I designed the codebase with scalability in mind, allowing for easy adjustment of parameters such as the number of processing workers.

### 5. Output Presentation:

Challenge: Presenting the matching results in a user-friendly and informative format.
Solution: I structured the output to list the top candidates for each job description. This user-friendly presentation facilitated efficient review and analysis.

### 6. Optimizing Embeddings and Similarity Calculation:

Challenge: Optimizing the speed and efficiency of embedding generation and similarity calculation.
Solution: I leveraged pre-trained DistilBERT embeddings and PyTorch for similarity calculations. GPU acceleration further expedited processing.

### 7. Testing and Validation:

Challenge: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the matching algorithm.
Solution: Rigorous testing and validation processes were implemented to validate the matching algorithm, guaranteeing meaningful and dependable results.

By tackling these challenges and implementing effective solutions, I successfully developed ResuMatch; a robust resume matching system capable of intelligently pairing candidates with job descriptions based on their qualifications and skills.
